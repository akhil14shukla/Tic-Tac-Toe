# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my first Python Project, although simple and easy but it has its value.
This project covers basic of function writing, conditional statements and python programming.

Defining functions for checking if the game is over, by manually giving conditions in which game ends with a player winning.
Then defining function for displaying the updated board of Tic Tac Toe
Rest of the part of taking input from both the player is done in the main function, though this can also be done by making a separate function for taking input and feeding it into the board.
This process is repeated until all the boxes are filled or at max 9 times or one of the player wins the game.

Have a great time playing Tic Tac Toe !!!
